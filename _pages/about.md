I completed my PhD in Computer Science at [Sapienza University of Rome](https://www.uniroma1.it/en/pagina-strutturale/home) in May 2024, working under the supervision of [Prof. Emanuele Rodol√†](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=-EH4wBYAAAAJ). My research focused on deep learning for music generation, separation and note transcription, utilizing diffusion models and transformers. I also worked on statistical inference with neural optimal transport. Following my PhD, I continued as a research contractor at Sapienza University until August 2024.

During my doctoral studies, I spent six months (March-August 2023) as a visiting researcher at [Technion - Israel Institute of Technology](https://www.technion.ac.il/en/), working with [Prof. Alex Bronstein](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=lafKN0sAAAAJ) on vector quantile regression. 

Before all that, I earned a MS degree in Computer Science and a BS in Math, both from Sapienza.
