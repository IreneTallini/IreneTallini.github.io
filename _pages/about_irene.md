I completed my PhD in Computer Science at Sapienza University of Rome in May 2024, working under the supervision of Prof. Emanuele Rodol√†. My research focused on deep learning for music generation, separation and note transcription, utilizing diffusion models and transformers. I also worked on statistical inference with neural optimal transport.

During my doctoral studies, I spent six months (March-August 2023) as a visiting researcher at Technion - Israel Institute of Technology, working with Prof. Alex Bronstein on vector quantile regression. Following my PhD, I continued as a research contractor at Sapienza University until August 2024.

My research has led to several publications in top-tier conferences, including an oral presentation at ICLR 2024 (top 1.2%) for our work on multi-source diffusion models for music generation and separation.
